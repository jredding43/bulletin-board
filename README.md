Bulletin Board Project


======================================================================================================================================================================================
About the Project
======================================================================================================================================================================================
This is my first full project using React and Tailwind CSS. The goal of this project is to create a bulletin board/job platform where users can post and find jobs locally in a simple, fair, and accessible way. The platform is designed to avoid recruiter dominance, ensuring that all job listings have equal visibility.

Features (Planned & Implemented)

ðŸ”¹ User Profiles: Users can create interactive job-seeker/business profiles.

ðŸ”¹ Job Listings: Users can post job opportunities with detailed descriptions.

ðŸ”¹ Filtering & Search: Ability to filter job postings by category, location, and availability.

ðŸ”¹ User Insights: Display useful insights such as job trends and market updates.

ðŸ”¹ Firebase Integration: The platform is backed by Firebase for authentication, database, and storage.
